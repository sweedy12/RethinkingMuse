The monoclonal antibody precipitates a series of glycoproteins (Leu 200) with a molecular weight range of about 190 ,000 to 230 ,000 from both T- and B-cell lines. The series of glycoproteins resolves into four discrete glycoprotein bands, the distribution of which varies according to the cell lines. Bands 3 and 4 predominate in a majority of T-cells whereas band 2 predominates in B cells. Thus, a Leu 200 antigen subset distribution is possible with mAb 4C. Bands 1, 2, 3, 4 have apparent molecular weights of 230K, 215K, 205K, and 190K respectively, with differences in their carbohydrate moieties. nAb 4C is a IgG sub two a ,kappa immunoglobulin. 4C has potential use in leukemia, hematopoietic cell differentiation and transplantation diagnoses and therapy."}, {"id": "4892850", "response": "The purpose of the patent is to provide a method for producing a tough corundum-rutile composite sintered body.
