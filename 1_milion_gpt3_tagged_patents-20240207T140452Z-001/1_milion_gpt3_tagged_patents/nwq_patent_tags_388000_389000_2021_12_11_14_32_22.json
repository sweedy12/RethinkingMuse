The rhenium, which need be present only in small amount permits full and complete reduction of the catalytic metal, or metals, dispersed by the acid. Higher catalyst activities with lower rhenium loadings are thus achieved than in previous preparations where higher concentrations of rhenium were required to both effectively disperse, and reduce the catalytic metal, or metals, during the preparation.
