By means of annular recesses, and hence control surfaces formed on piston collars about a piston core, the control piston regulates at least one fluid stream that flows through the housing. This regulation is effected by coupling the recesses between the piston collars, while appropriately longitudinally shifting the control piston, with annular control chambers on the housing side. The collars of the control piston are provided with control edges that progressively release the control chambers. The problem with heretofore known valves was that an undesired sudden increase in the flow forces could not be avoided. In addition, the manufacture of the corresponding configurations of the control edges was complicated and expensive. To remedy this problem, the course of the control edges that release or close the control chambers on the housing side, when viewed in the circumferential direction of the control piston, has no segment that extends linearly and at right angles to the center line of the piston. Each control edge follows a symmetrical course relative to a central cross section taken through its circumferential development, and each control edge also at least twice provides for the full cross-sectional opening area of the control piston."}, {"id": "4739800", "response": "The purpose of the patent is to provide a method of laying a pipe underwater.
