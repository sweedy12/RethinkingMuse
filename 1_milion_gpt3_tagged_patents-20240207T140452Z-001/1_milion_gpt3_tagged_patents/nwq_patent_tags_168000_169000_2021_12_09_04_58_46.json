This is accomplished by using a simple fixture which simulates the motor stator assembly and senses rotor magnet position. The stator simulating fixture may be used to rotatably adjust the position of the rotor casing so that the magnetic spring null corresponds to the hydraulic valve null. Both the stator simulating fixture and motor stator assembly include an index pin engageable with a stator alignment keyway in the rotor casing for maintaining the desired orientation therebetween. Also, rotor over-travel stops keyed to the rotor casing may be centered during the nulling process. Once the nulling process is complete, the stator simulating fixture may be removed and the motor stator assembly may be mounted in place. The motor stator assembly may be loosely held in an outer housing which has limited rotation relative to the motor stator assembly to permit a plug-in electrical connector for the stator windings on the exterior of the outer housing to be brought into alignment with a receptacle in the valve body and plugged into the receptacle without damaging the lead wires.
