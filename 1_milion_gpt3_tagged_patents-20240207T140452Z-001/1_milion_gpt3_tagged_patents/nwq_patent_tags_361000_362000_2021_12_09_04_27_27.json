Numerous intermediate levels are positioned between the mean level and the high and low levels. Several crossing numbers are obtained by counting how often the signal crosses the mean level and the intermediate levels during the time interval. These crossing numbers are plotted on a graph, wherein the crossing numbers are plotted against the relative distance between the levels. A curve is interpolated between the points thus obtained and an area under the curve is determined. The crossing numbers are normalized to the area to obtain normalized crossing numbers. Changes in these normalized crossing numbers are correlated with changes in specific flame characteristics of a particular burner operating under known conditions. Based on this correlation, observed changes in the normalized crossing numbers may then be used to recognize deviations from ideal combustion conditions.
