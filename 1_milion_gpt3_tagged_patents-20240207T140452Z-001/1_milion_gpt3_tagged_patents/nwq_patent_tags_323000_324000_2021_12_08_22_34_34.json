The rate at which the stack height is lessened as sheets are fed from the stack is then determined by a controller from the known distance between the predetermined maximum and minimum levels and a value corresponding to the speed at which sheets are fed from the stack. The speed value, or sheet cycle time, may be received from the sheet processing machine, or may be a time duration measured by a timer.
