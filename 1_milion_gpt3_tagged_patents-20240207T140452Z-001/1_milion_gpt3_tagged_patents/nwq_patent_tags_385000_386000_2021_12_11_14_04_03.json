The direction that passes through a rotating shaft of the motor and causes a magnetic flux to pass through permanent magnets is defined as a d-axis. Even when the motor is driven under the non-loading condition and no flow of electric currents through windings is required in response to a torque requirement, the method of the present invention applies a voltage to the d-axis, based on an estimated electrical angle. Application of the voltage is realized by switching on and off a transistor inverter with a delay of a dead time. The method solves voltage equations with the applied voltages and the electric currents corresponding to the voltages, and controls the motor while correcting the electrical angle with errors of the arithmetic operations. A dead-time correction is carried out prior to the solution of the voltage equations, based on the direction of the flow of the electric current through the d-axis. This eliminates the effects of the dead time on the switching operations."}, {"id": "5952823", "response": "The purpose of the patent is to provide a shock absorber.
