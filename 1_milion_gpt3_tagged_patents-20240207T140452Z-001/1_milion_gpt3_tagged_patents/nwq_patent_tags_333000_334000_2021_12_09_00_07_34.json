The gold-bearing ore and primary or carrier water are dynamically and circuitously displaced to segregate the gold, and precipitate the gold particles into predetermined recovery sites along the flow path of the mix. The master stream of gold-sized ore-primary water mix is subdivided into several separate streams or substreams. The substreams are violent in nature, with one exception, and are typically contained in man-made canal-forming troughs having multiple recovery sites. Recovery sites comprise one or more drop slots. A downward draw caused by flow of secondary water in a conduit located below each slot enhances recovery. Each trough includes a dynamic segregation box having successive compartments across which a top layer of turbulent flow continuously occurs. Within each compartment a bottom layer of laminar flow takes place not only within each compartment, but from compartment-to-compartment. The laminar flow at the bottom of the trough is damped by yieldable blade elements, causing particles of gold accordingly to settle between the blades. A violent central, middle or immediate layer of revolving turbulent flow occurs within barrier-defined compartments between the top unobstructed turbulent layer and bottom laminar layer of trough flow. Within each compartment, eddy currents are enhanced by a whipping action caused by yieldable flaps or flap segments."}, {"id": "5617959", "response": "The purpose of the patent is to provide a shoe rack.

A clamp member is positioned adjacent the mold plate when in the fill position, and pressure is applied on the clamp member to clamp the mold plate against the supply manifold. The clamp member and associated structure apply pressure to the clamp member compensating for deflection of these structural members which maintains the mold plate in firm clamping relation relative to the supply manifold. The clamp plate therefore does not operate in flexure, and eliminates the need to provide the clamp plate with a thick cross section or heavy mass which would accommodate forces normally encountered during filling of the mold cavities.
