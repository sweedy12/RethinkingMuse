The entire system is under water in the ocean so as to utilize the temperature differentials available between just below the surface of the ocean and approximately 100 meters below. The tape which is ferromagnetic passes through superconducting coils having parallel fields and thereby providing a very large magnetic field. The lower portion of the ferromagnetic tape, which is cooled by the ocean, experiences greater magnetization than the upper warmer portions of the magnetic tape. The lower portion of the tape experiencing greater magnetization is pulled up into the magnetic field and thereby causes movement of the tape. As the tape moves upward it is warmed by the ocean currents with the result that a lower portion of the tape now experiences the greater magnetization. This therefore causes continual movement. Attached to one of the pulleys is a drive belt arrangement which in turn is connected to a generator thereby causing the generator to turn and generate electricity upon movement of the magnetic tape."}, {"id": "4468599", "response": "The purpose of the patent is to provide a plug current regulator for a dc electric traction motor propelled vehicle.
