The invention is accomplished by removably adhering a droplet impingement recorder to a surface to be tested, such as an airfoil. The droplet impingement recorder incorporates a water soluble gelatin coating bonded to a substrate. Droplets suspended in the flow field impact upon the recording surface of the droplet impingement recorder.
