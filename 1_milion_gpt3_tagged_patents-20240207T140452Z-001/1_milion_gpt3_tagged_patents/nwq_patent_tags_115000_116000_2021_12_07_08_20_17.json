The styli are moved back and forth across the paper, marking in both directions. The carriage is not stepped across the page, but instead is moved smoothly from one side to the other side under control of a velocity servo. A controller generates and applies velocity command inputs to the servo, based on the position of the carriage as sensed by an optical encoder, and based on certain characteristics of the incoming signal. A first buffer memory accumulates the incoming signal until a line has been stored for plotting, while a second buffer memory is applying its accumulated contents to the printhead. Thereafter, the first memory supplies the printhead while the second memory accumulates.
