The de-epilthelialization devices generally utilize a non-cutting separator or dissector that is configured to separate the epithelium at a naturally occurring cleavage surface in the eye between the epithelium and the corneal stroma (Bowman's membrane), specifically separating in the region of the lamina lucida. The separator or dissector may have a structure that rolls or vibrates (or both) at that cleavage surface or interface during the dissection step. The separated epithelium may be lifted or peeled from the surface of the eye to form an epithelial flap or a pocket. The epithelium may then be replaced on the cornea after a refractive procedure or after placement of an ocular lens (or other subepithelial device) on the eye. The subepithelial device may comprise a wide variety of synthetic, natural, or composite polymeric materials.

The measured signals are then fed into a signal scrubber which uses the coefficients to remove the unwanted portions. The signal scrubbing is performed in either the time domain or in the frequency domain. The method and apparatus are particularly advantageous to blood oximetry and pulserate measurements. In another embodiment, an estimate of the pulserate is obtained by applying a set of rules to a spectral transform of the scrubbed signal.

Motor temperature Ti (i=1, 2... n) and the current feedback Ifi of each motor are read out from the temperature detector for detecting the temperature of each motor of the machine tool. The heating value Qi of each motor is obtained from current feedback Ifi. Motor temperature Ti is calculated and estimated from the heating value Q. Difference \u0394Ti between the estimated motor temperature Tmi and the detected temperature Tsi is obtained. When difference between maximum and minimum values of difference \u0394Ti exceeds the first threshold value \u03b2, a temperature detector abnormality is outputted. When it is equal to or less than the first threshold value \u03b2, the mean value \u0394T\u2032 of differences is obtained. If the mean value \u0394T\u2032 is equal to or less than the second threshold value \u03b3, it is determined that there is no abnormality.
