The vacuum combiner includes one or more conveyor belt-type surfaces, while the vacuum conveyor has a single belt-type surface, all of which have openings defined therein. Both devices also have at least two guide rail assemblies, and a vacuum source that adds a \"drag\" or \"weighing\" force on the light-weight containers moved thereon. The conveyor belt-type surfaces of the combiner and the conveyor may or may not be moving at the same velocity. The guide rail assemblies are each comprised of a plurality of rods and rollers, wherein the rollers are aligned in a unique anti-jamming staggered or diamond pattern. The guide rail assemblies are positioned such that they are either substantially upright, or are positioned such that each is inclined over and above the conveyor surfaces. The rods within the guide rail assemblies may be substantially vertical, or they may be inclined forward. One vacuum source may be used for the plurality of conveyor surfaces, or one vacuum source may be used for each individual conveyor. The vacuum force should be such that it is greatest on the discharge conveyor surface and lowest on the infeed conveyor surface.

Methods and compositions are disclosed for treating or preventing adverse CNS effects produced by NMDA receptor hypofunction (NRH), including hypofunction induced by NMDA antagonist drugs, and hypofunction occurring as a causative or aggravating factor in schizophrenia. One method of this invention comprises administering an alpha-2 adrenergic (.alpha.2) receptor agonist drug along with an NMDA antagonist drug. The NMDA antagonist drug exerts a primary benefit in reducing excitotoxic brain damage, alleviating neuropathic pain, or preventing or avoiding tolerance or addiction to various types of drugs. The .alpha.2 agonist drug acts as a secondary or \"safener\" drug, to prevent the neurotoxic side effects that would be caused by the NMDA antagonist in the absence of the safener drug. Another method disclosed herein involves the use of an .alpha.2 agonist drug, by itself, to combat a different and naturally-occurring form of NMDA receptor hypofunction which occurs as a causative or aggravating mechanism in people suffering from schizophrenia. Although .alpha.2 agonists are usually not effective in treating long-standing cases of chronic schizophrenia, where pathological changes in the brain have already reached or approached maximal levels, .alpha.2 agonists can be administered early in the illness, such as at the first signs of schizophrenic illness, and continuously or intermittently thereafter to prevent the development or worsening of pathological brain changes."}, {"id": "5605916", "response": "The purpose of the patent is to provide a method of treating neurological disorders.
