When both electrodes touch water in the sump below the fuel the detector circuit energizes a warning signal. The electrodes are connected to the opposite ends of a winding of a transformer having another winding which forms a leg of a voltage divider. The other leg of the voltage divider constitutes a resistor. The voltage divider is energized by an AC source of electrical energy whereby AC energy is applied to the electrodes. A signal taken from across the resistor is applied to an operational amplifier the output of which is adapted to trigger a solid state switch having an output connected to an electrically activatable warning device. When the electrodes are both in water the resistance between them becomes low so that the impedance of the second winding of the transformer becomes low and the signal appearing across the resistor becomes high, thereby causing the operational amplifier to trigger the solid state switch and energize the electrically activatable warning device."}, {"id": "3950759", "response": "The purpose of the patent is to provide a portable recording instrument for recording the magnitude of both welding current and operating duration.
