The seal element has a first radial surface which forms an acute heel angle with the groove first radial surface, and the seal element forms an inner static area adjacent the groove axial surface and first radial surface. Upon installation of a rod and low pressure application, the seal element is compressed into the groove, and the seal element first radial surface is moved into contact with the groove first radial surface. Thus, the seal element prevents contamination from entering into the inner static area. The seal element has first and second angled surfaces forming a high pressure sealing line and third and fourth angled surfaces forming a low pressure sealing line with a stress-relieving radius interconnecting the second and third angled surfaces. When the seal element is positioned in the groove, the angled surfaces face in the direction of and partially protrude through the groove mouth. The stress-relieving radius relieves excessive tensile stress, thereby alleviating the problem of cracking at the sealing face and premature seal failure. Moreover, the stress-relieving radius provides better flexing motion to the low pressure sealing lip, thereby avoiding high compressive stress and reducing the compressive set on the low pressure sealing lip."}, {"id": "5431418", "response": "The purpose of the patent is to provide a metal gasket.
