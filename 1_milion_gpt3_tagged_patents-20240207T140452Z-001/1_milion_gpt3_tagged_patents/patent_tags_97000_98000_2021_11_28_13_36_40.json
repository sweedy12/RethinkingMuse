The efficiency of a muscle is defined by the ability of the brain to bridge a proper communication to the muscle by sending normal action potentials; the bridge is often compromised during injury, improper training, or from poor habits of bodily movement. The standardization of these efficiencies allows for the isolation of particular areas of the muscles that are inefficient and efficient. Further, with varied application of electrical pulses, a bridge that mimics the natural action potential is provided and can enhance muscle efficiency in a way that achieves higher levels of success in bodily healing and physical training than in any prior art. The current invention uses multiple, select sets of electrical currents at sound wave frequencies with specific forms of movements. The application of electrical currents can also be synchronized with extensions and contractions of muscles to stimulate the expedited bridging of brain to muscle and increase the efficiency of muscles. The current invention discloses a system to deliver these electrical currents and offers the capabilities to standardize these techniques to reconnect the brain to these muscles to an efficient level."}, {"id": "10232173", "response": "The purpose of the patent is to provide a method for treating a patient with a medical condition.
