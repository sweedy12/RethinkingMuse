Further, the two line sources and the two detector windows all move in synchronization in the direction of the long axis of the object being scanned and at any given position all are within a given spatial plane that is transverse to the long axis of the object. In this configuration, the system can effectively reduce the amount of cross-talk detected by a detector (e.g., cross-talk being scattered photon radiation detected by a given detector but not originating from the detector's associated line source).

Such a technique improves the quantitative capability of emission data by acquiring non-truncated attenuation factors. The emission data of a small field of view window is collected so that high resolution image pixels are used for processing the emission data (e.g., of a particular body organ). Since a large field of view is used for collecting the transmission data, the imaging pixels for transmission data are of lower resolution than the emission data. The emission data can be collected using a roving zoom technique during an ECT scan. A computation adjusts the transmission data to account for the known location of the emission zoom window on the crystal and for the different pixel sizes between the full field of view transmission scan of the body and the smaller roving electronic field of view emission scan of the body organ."}, {"id": "5598048", "response": "The purpose of the patent is to provide a magnetic bearing for a motor.
