The press has a ram in operable communication with a drive and a computer in communication with the ram and drive to accurately control movement of the ram and depth of insertion of each tube. Carried by the ram is a probe that senses flange location relative on the tube for determining deviation in flange location and offsetting depth of insertion to compensate for any such deviation. Another sensor communicates to the computer the insertion force the ram is applying to the tube to determine tube and press deflection. Where a pair of tubes are inserted at the same time, the computer compares insertion force of both tubes to determine if there is any force imbalance causing deflection and/or shifting of the workpiece fixtures. During insertion, and preferably as the tube is nearing full depth of insertion, the computer communicates with each force sensor and preferably at least one lookup table to select an offset for each tube corresponding to press and tube deflection and another offset corresponding to force imbalance. Thereafter, the computer applies the offsets to the insertion depth of each tube to accurately locate each flange relative to the housing locator when assembly is completed."}, {"id": "5537744", "response": "The purpose of the patent is to provide a tappet for an IC engine.
