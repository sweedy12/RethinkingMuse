Special spring-loaded molds having variable-volume mold cavities are used in an injection-compression molding process to form, without parting line flash, pairs of a wide range of differing optical power of polycarbonate Rx spectacle lenses. These pairs have special molded-on design features which are specially suited for full automation, starting with a novel way for ejection out of the mold into a takeout robot which is integrated via full automation with subsequent dip hardcoating. A molded-on tab with each pair of lenses is specially suited for manipulation by SCARA type robot. This combination produces micro-clean hardcoated paired molded lens made entirely within a single continuous cleanroom air enclosure surrounding the lenses, without any human operators therein, nor requiring any cutting or trimming of the molded paired lens or runner system before hardcoating, nor use of Freon (tm) CFC nor aqueous cleaning protocols before dipcoating. An extension of this cleanroom enclosure and robotic handling scheme may optionally provide in-line continuous-product-flow automatic inspection of optical power and lens cosmetic quality, and/or may optionally provide in-line continuous-product-flow anti-reflective thin film vacuum coating, before the molded-and-hardcoated polycarbonate lenses exit out of the continuous cleanroom air enclosure and/or receive any manual handling."}, {"id": "5718853", "response": "The purpose of the patent is to provide a method for preconditioning preforms prior to reheating the preforms for blow molding.
