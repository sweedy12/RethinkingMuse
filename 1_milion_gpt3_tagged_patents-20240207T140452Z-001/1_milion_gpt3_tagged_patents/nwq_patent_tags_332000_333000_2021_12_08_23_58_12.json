Heat is applied to each end of the gasket sections and the ends are brought into contact with one another. As the ends cool, a welded joint is formed. The integrity of each individual chamber is maintained so that, when spliced, the two gaskets sections become one, with the chambers forming continuous channels. The continuous channels create a higher insulating quality than if the channels were blocked at the welded joints. Further, corners spliced in this manner remain as flexible as the adjoining gasket sections. Magnetic strips may be inserted into selected channels to assist in maintaining the proper position of the gasket when in use as well as provide a magnetic latch.

The grippers transfer the band of material to the bonding station in a direction transverse to the transfer of the tabs to the bonding station, and the ends of the band are placed in overlapping relationship with the tabs. Subsequently, a pair of ultrasonic welding horns are moved into contact with the overlapping material to fuse the band of material to the tabs.
