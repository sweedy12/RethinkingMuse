Use of the two mechanisms results, in commercial scale cyclone combustors, in 70 to 90% sulphur capture at economical Ca/S ratios. The method also minimizes emission of ash by removal from the pulverized coal fuel particles too small to be retained in the combustor and too large to be completely burned in the combustor, minimizes reevolution of sulphur compounds from slag by rapid and continuous removal of slag from the combustor, minimizes emission of NO.sub.x pollutants by maintaining a favorable overall fuel-rich stoichiometry."}, {"id": "4765261", "response": "The purpose of the patent is to provide a cultivator.
