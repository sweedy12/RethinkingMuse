The system utilizes a set of on-board sensors to define two independent angular measurements, which will initially identify the z-axis orientation of the spacecraft from an arbitrary attitude after launch vehicle separation. A set of three-axis gyros are then bias calibrated in order to measure the transverse rates of the spacecraft. The three-axis attitude of the spacecraft is continously determined by integrating the gyro outputs even if the Earth or Sun is not visible by an on-board sensor. A state estimator model is provided to determine the three-axis attitude of the spacecraft in the presence of large wobble and nutation. The system also utilizes a linear combination of the estimated attitude, rate and acceleration states to generate commanded rate increments with a pulse-width frequency modulator. The pulse-width frequency modulator seeks to linearize the inherently non-linear thruster duty cycle."}, {"id": "5452872", "response": "The purpose of the patent is to provide a stabilizer system for portable irrigation equipment.
