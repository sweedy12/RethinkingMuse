Reverse movement of the piston causes the opposite effect at the respective chamber ports. A compression seal is provided at the median section of the piston and at opposite non-adjacent end portions of the syringe chambers. The syringe housing can be formed in two separable sections to permit access to the compression seal at the median portion of the piston.
