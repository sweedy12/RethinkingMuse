The context of the patent is fermented milk field, in particular, a process of preparing fermented milk beverage keeping high viable cell count at ambient temperature. The invention provides a process of preparing fermented milk beverage keeping high viable cell count at ambient temperature. The process includes the steps of adding regular yoghurt lactobacillus into milk for fermentation, fermenting until pH value to 3.8-4.8, diluting, mixing and sterilizing with conventional method, adding concentrated culture, concentrated frozen culture or freeze dried culture containing Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 53103 into mixed milk beverage at aseptic condition. According to various pH value of finished product, it can be stored at ambient temperature for 1-6 months, and the viable cell count will not be less than 105 cfu/ml milk beverage.
