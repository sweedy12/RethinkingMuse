For this reason, these materials are very difficult to form and cannot be used for the intended purpose. Their properties can be decisively improved by impressing upon the alloys a grain size of less than 50 .mu.m by hot-forming or by sintering, for example, or by some other process, and by selecting the composition of the alloy with the intent to keep the quantity of the transition metal component A at a value not lower than stochiometric value.
