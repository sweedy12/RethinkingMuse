The pump includes an outer tube forming an outer chamber and an inner or dip tube placed within the outer chamber of the outer tube and forming an inner chamber. A well float includes the fluid inlet and has a density which enable the float to remain in proximity to the water/hydrocarbon interface. A tubular coil or conduit provides fluid passage between the fluid inlet and the outer chamber. Also, a fluid separator is located at the bottom end of the outer tube and defines a fluid passage between the inner and outer chambers. In one configuration, the separator allows water to exit the pump from the outer chamber while the hydrocarbons remain within the outer chamber. In a second configuration, the separator prevents water from entering the pump and enables hydrocarbons to be discharged from the pump.
