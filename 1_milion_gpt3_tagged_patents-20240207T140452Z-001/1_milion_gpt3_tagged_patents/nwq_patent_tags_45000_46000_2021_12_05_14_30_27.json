The basic system can also be utilized on marine, land and air vehicles. The enriched slurry mixture of waste is pumped into a reactor chamber where through an electrolitic reaction it causes the slurry to produce its own pressure achieving the by-products of high pressure steam to drive a turbine-driven electrical generator and sterilized water with only a residue of ash being produced. The by-product of electricity may be utilized for heating the slurry mixture in the reactor while providing electrical power for other uses. Excess condensate from the steam may then be collected and utilized as sterilized water. The system is designed for use at the municipal level to combine various sources of organic-type wate, such as garbage, trash, sewage, to a common disposal point in the community which produces an ash residue with by-products of power and sterilized water being achieved from the total system.
