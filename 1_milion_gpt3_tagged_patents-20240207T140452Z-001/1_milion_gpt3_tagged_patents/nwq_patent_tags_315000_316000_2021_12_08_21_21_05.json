To support this greater length of the cylinder, support wheels are provided one per each foot of length along the cylinder and the frame attaches to the cylinder on both sides. In order to provide access for the removal of the cover of the cylinder, one side of the frame pivots away from the cylinder. The frame has an arm that is hinged and another arm that is split such that it has two semi-circular portions. When the hinged arm pivots, the split arm separates and the frame is removed from one end of the cylinder, thus allowing for easy removal of the cover. During use of the paint roller, the split arm and the hinge are covered by lock nuts so as to avoid the pivoting of the frame during painting.
