Central to the invention is the use of a braided metallic reinforcing member, typically of a stainless steel or super-elastic alloy ribbon, situated within the catheter body in such a way to create a catheter section having a thin wall, controlled stiffness, and high resistance to kinking. The distal-most section of the catheter is much more flexible than are other braided catheters of the genre due to choice of braid construction features of that distal-most section. The distal-most braid, and optionally, intermediate braid components are constructed to be more flexible than the more proximal sections due to deletion of ribbons from the braid structure, change of ribbon material, and change of pitch. The various sections include braids which may have a consistent pitch or may vary in pitch along the axis of the catheter or catheter section. The braided ribbon reinforcing member typically is placed between a flexible outer tubing member and an inner tubing member to produce a catheter section which is very flexible but highly kink resistant. The more proximal sections of the catheter assembly are often substantially stiffer than the more distal sections also due to the presence of stiff polymeric tubing or composited materials in the stiffer section."}, {"id": "5891118", "response": "The purpose of the patent is to provide a disposable absorbent article.

The first chamber communicates, in addition to the gas passage, with the liquid to be dispensed, and the second chamber is gas tight except for the gas passage. In order to receive liquid in the dispensing device, the volume of the second chamber is increased, resulting in gas flowing therein from the first chamber, and in turn, liquid to be dispensed flowing into the first chamber until a pressure equilibrium between the chambers has been reached. According to the invention the change in temperature of the gas flowing from the first chamber to the second is measured, and the change in volume effected in the second chamber is corrected based on the measured temperature change so that the desired quantity of liquid is received in the first chamber.
