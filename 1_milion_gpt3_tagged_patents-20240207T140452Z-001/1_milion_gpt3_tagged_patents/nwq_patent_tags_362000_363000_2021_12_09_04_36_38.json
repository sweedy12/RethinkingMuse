The grommet assembly includes inner and outer grommet members which are relatively telescopically arranged. The outer grommet member has a rearwardly opening cup shaped configuration, is formed of a resilient material, and includes a tapered forward portion sized to fit in the panel aperture. The inner grommet member has a forwardly opening cup shaped configuration, is formed of a rigid material, and includes an annular wall telescopically received within the annular wall of the outer grommet member and engaging a front wall of the outer grommet member at a location forwardly of the annular groove. The tapered forward portion is initially positioned in the panel aperture in frictional engagement with the aperture whereafter a pushing force is applied on the rear end of the inner grommet member to pull the forward end of the outer grommet member through the panel aperture and seat the circumferential groove in the panel aperture. An opening in the inner grommet member communicates with an opening in the front wall of the outer grommet member to allow the elongated element to pass sequentially through the openings in the inner and outer grommet members. The grommet assembly is especially suitable for use where the panel aperture is difficult to access such as where a thick layer of insulation is positioned in surrounding relation to the panel aperture for sound deadening purposes."}, {"id": "5806143", "response": "The purpose of the patent is to provide a three-segmented expandable pull rod for luggage.
