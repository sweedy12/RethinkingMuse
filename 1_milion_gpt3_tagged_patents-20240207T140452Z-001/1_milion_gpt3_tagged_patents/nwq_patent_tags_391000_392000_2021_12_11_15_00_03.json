A diaphragm spring annular pivot is provided on the supports, on the clutch cover side of the diaphragm spring. One edge of the conical spring is supported on an engagement surface of the clutch cover, and the other edge is seated on the diaphragm spring. Engagement tabs project from the edge of the conical spring that is supported on the clutch cover. The engagement tabs are engaged into conical spring engagement holes formed in the clutch cover, or in an alternative embodiment, into inter-digital holes of the diaphragm spring not penetrated by the circularly spaced supports. The engagement tabs thus rigidly retain the conical spring against rotation relative to the clutch cover, or in the alternative embodiment, relative to the diaphragm spring. The configuration reduces the axial dimension of the assembly, on the clutch cover side of the diaphragm spring, to the axial height of the conical spring/diaphragm spring annular pivot, thereby reducing the bending moment on the supports when the clutch is operated."}, {"id": "5988342", "response": "The purpose of the patent is to provide a braking device for a linear motor table.
