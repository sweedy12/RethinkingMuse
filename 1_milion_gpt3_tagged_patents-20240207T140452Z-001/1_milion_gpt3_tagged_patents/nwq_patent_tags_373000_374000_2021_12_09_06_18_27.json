The aerostabilizer wing is mounted distal from the tailgate by use of low drag airfoil shaped stanchions that are attached to forward and upper portions of the tailgate in the preferred embodiment. The nose of the aerostabilizer wing is angled down so that the aerostabilizer wing acts as a turning vane to direct pressurized air from an aerodynamic pressure front that builds up on the forward side of the tailgate at highway speeds up and out over the top of the tailgate thereby reducing drag. Due to its downward angled and at least partially airfoil shaped design, the aerostabilizer wing also places a downward force on the tailgate thus helping to stabilize the pickup truck when traveling forward. Limitations on the downward angle of the nose of the aerostabilizer wing and of the gap distance between the aerostabilizer wing and the tailgate are established. End treatments of the aerostabilizer wing in both spanwise and chordwise directions are also given. The instant invention aerostabilizer wing and its mounting stanchions are all, in their preferred embodiments, at least partially airfoil shaped to insure a simple yet strong and appealing structure that offers minimum aerodynamic resistance.
