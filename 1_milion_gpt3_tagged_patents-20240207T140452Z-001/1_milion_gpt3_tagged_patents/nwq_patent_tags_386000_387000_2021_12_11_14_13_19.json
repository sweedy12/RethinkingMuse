The hot exit stream and the warm exit stream are cross-exchanged to smooth out the temperature variations which reduce the size and operating cost of producing the chilled stream. Potential damage to equipment and variation operations can be avoided by selecting the location of the side draw stream to avoid the accumulation of non-condensables in the heat exchange equipment. The process provides significant economic benefits operating cost savings in refinery and petrochemical applications where fractionation column overhead liquids are available at waste heat temperatures above about 80.degree.
