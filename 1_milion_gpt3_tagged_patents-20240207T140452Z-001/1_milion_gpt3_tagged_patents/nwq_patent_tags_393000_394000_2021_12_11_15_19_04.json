The incident collimated light is transmitted through and backscattered out of a breast. Normal and diseased breast materials exhibit comparatively distinct characteristics when exposed to radiation and are thereby differentiated. Collimation can also be used to control the level of scattered radiation. Radiation coupling materials can be employed during image acquisition to enhance radiation coupling into and out of the breast as well as providing desirable absorption and scattering properties. Additional scatter reduction and/or improved sensitivity can be attained by compressing a region of the breast using contoured and/or flat compression plates of various sizes which may include an open region allowing access to the surface of the breast for irradiating a portion of the breast.
