This chamber also receives outside air to assist in the actual combustion process. From the first reburn chamber, the gases go to a second reburn chamber to complete the combustion. There, they receive additional oxygen for this purpose. At temperatures above a set point determined near the third chamber, additional air enters to prevent excessive temperatures.

The head sits on the card and contains a quantity of ink at ambient pressure and temperature. As the head and card move relative one another, the ink is subjected to a shear force, and a bottom surface layer of the ink is drawn into a trailing wall of the head, which wall contains a metering orifice. This orifice is of gradually increasing cross-section. That is, the orifice's entrance area is smaller than is its exit area. In this manner, the ink is subjected to a coating interface through which the ink experiences a reduction in hydrodynamic pressure, and a decrease in velocity, as the volume of the coating orifice increases.
