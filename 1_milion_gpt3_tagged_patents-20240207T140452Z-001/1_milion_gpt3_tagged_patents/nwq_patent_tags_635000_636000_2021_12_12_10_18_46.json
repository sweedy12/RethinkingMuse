Techniques are described for adaptively adjusting detection thresholds for use in detecting cardiac ischemia and other abnormal physiological conditions based on morphological parameters derived from intracardiac electrogram (IEGM) signals, impedance measurements, or other signals. In one example, where ST segment elevation is used to detect cardiac ischemia, default detection thresholds are determined in advance from an examination of variations in ST segment elevations occurring within a population of patients. Thereafter, an individual pacemaker or other implantable medical device uses the default thresholds during an initial learning period to detect ischemia within the patient in which the device is implanted. During the initial learning period, the pacemaker also collects data representative of the range of variation in ST segment elevations occurring within the patient. The pacemaker then adaptively adjusts the thresholds based on the range of variation so as to improve detection specificity within the patient."}, {"id": "7769439", "response": "The purpose of the patent is to provide a method and apparatus for brain balancing.
