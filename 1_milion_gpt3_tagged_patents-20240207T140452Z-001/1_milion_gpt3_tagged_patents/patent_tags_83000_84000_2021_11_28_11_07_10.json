UAV's are typically remote controlled helicopters, quad-copters, airplanes and other airborne vehicles (e.g., Drones). Aircraft operating at low altitudes are subject to interference (accidental or purposefully) by those on the ground operating said UAV's, which is likely to cause great injury or death to the aircraft and its occupants."}, {"id": "10198958", "response": "The purpose of the patent is to provide a method and apparatus for training a team by employing brainwave monitoring and synchronized attention levels of team trainees. The context of the patent is human performance training (HPT) and, more particularly, to training environments implementing computer-guided training, with or without an instructor. Training methods and apparatus wherein a training environment is activated only when a trainee is in a focused attention state. A brainwave monitor is employed for determining level of attention. The training environment is activated when the level of attention of the trainee is at or above a predetermined attention threshold. Activation of the training environment provides feedback to the trainee that he or she is in a focused attention state, and at the same time provides the incentive to remain in the focused attention state. A focused attention state is important if not required for training/learning success. The method and apparatus may be employed for training individual trainees, as well as for training team member trainees."}, {"id": "10198972", "response": "The purpose of the patent is to provide a tamper seal.
