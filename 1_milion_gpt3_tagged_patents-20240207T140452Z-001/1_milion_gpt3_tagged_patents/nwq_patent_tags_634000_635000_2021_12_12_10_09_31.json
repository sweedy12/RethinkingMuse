Each lug curves so that a central section at the center of the tire width is located on the surface ahead on the circumference of adjoining sections of the lug that extend toward each of the opposing sidewalls. In this manner, each lug appears to have a curved \u201cbanana\u201d shape that extends across the width of the tire contact surface in a generally axial alignment. The grooves between lugs extend generally axially across the width, as a result. They are narrowed, having a circumferential width that is between approximately 20% and 30% of the average circumferential width of a lug. This geometry places more lug surface in contact with the road for better handling and longer tread life and provides less groove space to retain mud and detritus.
