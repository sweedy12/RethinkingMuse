According to this Invention the active integrated circuit system on a chip is manufactured of a glass capsule containing a porous membrane which allows the free flow of bodily fluids into and out of the capsule. The enzymes in the bodily fluids of mammals produce sufficient electrical charge to power an active RFID transponder. This electrical charge is harnessed through the auspices of a standard chemical process utilizing a nano anode and cathode manufactured as an integral part of the system on a chip integrated chip capsule. The capsule or casing is coated with bio friendly enzymes which promote the surrounding tissue to grow up to the glass casing or capsule and bond with it. This is for the purpose of securing the capsule in one position in the body. The result is an active RFID transponder mammalian implant which can be interrogated from distances greater than those available with passive transponders. The negative fluidic and tissue influence of the mammalian body on electro magnetic signals is obviated by low frequency interrogation.

The dual spools of the pressure control valve, although physically independent of one another, function in cooperation with one another in an attempt to maintain a state of equilibrium in the system, namely to keep pressure acting on or within the actuator (the load pressure), or the feedback pressure corresponding to the load pressure, the same as the control or pilot pressure.
