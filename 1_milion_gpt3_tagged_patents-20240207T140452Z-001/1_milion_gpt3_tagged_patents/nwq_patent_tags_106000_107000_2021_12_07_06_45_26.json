The core of the screw has a successively increasing diameter along the major part of its length such that the space defined between the core and the wall of the drum gradually decreases in the feed direction. According to the invention the drum is arranged to rotate at a speed which differs from the speed of rotation of the screw. The speed of rotation of the drum is so selected that there is obtained, as the result of the centrifugal force, an effective draining through the drum of free liquid present in the slurry and liquid pressed from said slurry due to the action of the press-screw.
