The shifted laser surface texturing method is a method of writing of large arrays of small objects (5) on surface or inside of a material. The whole array of objects (5) is produced by repeated linear raster (1) laser processing with sequential shifting of linear raster between each repetition of the scanning process. The linear raster is a set of paths (1) for laser beam scanning. Distance between spots (2) in the laser beam path (1) of the linear raster is defined by speed of laser beam scanning and by period between laser pulses. Sequence of linear raster shifts (4) defines the form of the small objects (5) in the array. Computational data for an array of the same objects (5) is very low. It is comparable to the number of lines N in one linear raster plus number of spots in one object.
