This process increases the heat transfer along local pins which are located around each truncated dimple. This effect allows the use of taller pins than previous devices thus increasing the surface of heat transfer and thus these pins have a more efficient heat transfer coefficient along the total length of the pin, not possible previously. Star pins with sharp edges prevent the distortion of the highly efficient vortex flow which increases fluid flow and simultaneously intensifies the desired phenomena of extraordinary turbulence."}, {"id": "7578340", "response": "The purpose of the patent is to provide a heat exchanger.
