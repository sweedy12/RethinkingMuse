The context of the patent is a method for forming a well-defined micrometer scale conductive wire or pathway comprising conductive particles on a generic substrate using an electric field. A sensor is achieved by applying a layer of a mixture that contains polymer and conductive particles over a substrate or first surface, when the mixture has a first viscosity that allows the conductive particles to rearrange within the material. An electric field is applied over the layer, so that a number of the conductive particles are assembled into one or more chain-like conductive pathways with the field and thereafter the viscosity of the layer is changed to a second, higher viscosity, in order to mechanically stabilize the material. The conductivity of the pathway is highly sensitive to the deformations and it can therefore act as deformation sensor.
