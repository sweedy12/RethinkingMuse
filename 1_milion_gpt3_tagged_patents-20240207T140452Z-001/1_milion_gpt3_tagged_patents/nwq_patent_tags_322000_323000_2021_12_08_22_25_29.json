The filled adhesive is applied to the surfaces to be joined and the surfaces are pressed together with a force in the range of 35 to 105 Kg/sq cm while the adhesive is curing. A fixture is disclosed made of a metal with a coefficient of thermal expansion less than the parts being joined. When the parts are held in the fixture and heated, differential thermal expansion causes the fixture to apply the necessary pressure during curing while also providing a measure of the applied pressure. For joining a cooling fin normal to the surface of a part, a tapered plug is formed in the fin edge and it is forced into a tapered slot in the part after adhesive application. A low external perpendicular force applied to the fin yields a high pressure to the mating surfaces through the inclined plane. The external force may then be removed and the parts cured. The tapered plug and slots holds the pressure enough to ensure a strong thermally conductive joint."}, {"id": "5554243", "response": "The purpose of the patent is to provide a method for manufacturing absorbent members.
