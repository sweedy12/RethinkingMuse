The longitudinal section interconnecting the inlet and outlet portions is maintained at a substantially uniform depth relative to the earth's surface while at the same time being oriented in a direction relative to the earth's centrifugal forces so as to maximize the effect of such forces on the liquid contained within the section thereby to produce a velocity head sufficient to drive a turbo-generating system to produce electric power."}, {"id": "4796430", "response": "The purpose of the patent is to provide a cam drive for a cryogenic refrigerator.

The ends of these ribs remote from the floating joints are interconnected by a centrally located mechanical joint structure. The floating joint connections between the elongated pads and the ribs are disposed generally in the middle of the pads and are sufficiently flexible to allow each pad to fit snugly, along its entire length, against a wearer's leg when the knee guard and brace is strapped to it. This closeness of fit is achieved without elaborate custom-fitting. Once the knee guard and brace is secured to a wearer's leg, movement of the section of each pad proximate the knee joint inwardly and away from the ribs can be prevented by adjusting the position of spacers rotatably attached to the ribs. Positioning the spacers to accommodate a particular user is readily accomplished by rotating each spacer until it barely touches a bracket mounted on the support pad next to the rib and then fixing the spacer in that configuration. With the spacers so fixed, straps attached to the ends of the support pads proximate the knee can be utilized with these pads to support a knee with a weakened medial collateral ligament against inwardly directed non-contact forces. Moreover, the ribs can deform inwardly essentially independently of the support pads, thereby protecting the knee against contact forces."}, {"id": "4796613", "response": "The purpose of the patent is to provide a lithotripsy work station.
