The arrowhead has a hollow ferrule covered by a grooved resin sleeve. A point at the forward end of the ferrule presents an interior inclined surface at the forward end of each groove. A blade with an inclined cutting edge fits into each groove so that the cutting edge contacts the inclined surface pressing the blade into the bottom of the groove. A retaining ring at the rear end of the groove encircles tabs on the blades and drives the blades forward to hold the blades in place as the arrowhead is screwed onto the shaft. Deformable lands on the groove bottom allow the arrowhead's adjustable alignment to be adjusted while maintaining pressure on the blades. The point has a secondary facet directly in front of each cutting edge to enhance penetration and the ferrule has a narrowing cross section behind the point for the same reason. A weight rod fits inside the hollow ferrule and seats against the point. The weight rod is scored so that pieces can be broken off to adjust its weight. The point also has a seat for the structural tube to be pressed into so on impact the tube cannot spread thus creating all forces to be dispersed equally throughout the arrow shaft."}, {"id": "5482296", "response": "The purpose of the patent is to provide a seal for a bore.
