In order to provide a method for culturing an immunopotentiator-containing organism having the experience of being eaten, inexpensively without requiring usage of a component derived from an animal, Acetobacter, Gluconobacter, Xanthomonas, Zymomonas or Enterobacter which is an edible gram-negative bacterium having an immunopotentiation function is cultured using a culture solution composed mainly of wheat or bean curd refuse. Thereby, Acetobacter can be obtained inexpensively and safely, and also a low molecular weight lipopolysaccharide which is the immunopotentiator can be obtained inexpensively and safely. Furthermore, no impurity derived from animal components is mixed."}, {"id": "10017730", "response": "The purpose of the patent is to provide a method for sterilizing livestock bedding by using a predetermined Bacillus coagulans thermophilic bacterium or a combination of the Bacillus coagulans thermophilic bacterium and a Bacillus subtilis mesophilic bacterium.
