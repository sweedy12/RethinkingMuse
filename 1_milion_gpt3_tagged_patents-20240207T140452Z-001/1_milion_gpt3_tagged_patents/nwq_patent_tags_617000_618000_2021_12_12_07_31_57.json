The context of the patent is methods and pharmaceutical compositions for preconditioning and/or providing neuroprotection to the animal central nervous system against the effects of ischemia, trauma, metal poisoning and neurodegeneration, including the associated cognitive, behavioral and physical impairments. In one embodiment, the method is accomplished by stimulating and stabilizing hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1). HIF-1\u03b1 is known to provide a neuroprotective benefit under ischemic conditions. Patients at risk for certain diseases or disorders that are associated with risk for cerebral ischemia may benefit, e.g., those at risk for Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Wilson's disease or stroke or those patients having head or spinal cord injury. Patients undergoing certain medical procedures that may result in ischemia may also benefit. Initially, the possibility of ischemia or neurodegeneration is recognized. Intranasal therapeutic agents are administered to the upper third of the nasal cavity to bypass the blood-brain barrier and access the central nervous system directly to avoid unwanted and potentially lethal side effects. Therapeutic agents include those substances that interact with iron and/or copper such as iron chelators, copper chelators, and antioxidants. A particular example of such therapeutic agents is the iron chelator deferoxamine (DFO). Intranasal administration of DFO is known to stimulate and/or stabilize HIF-1\u03b1 and provides an efficient and safe method for pre-conditioning the brain to protect against cerebral ischemia. Moreover, DFO is shown to decrease weight loss in subjects when administered pre and/or post stroke."}, {"id": "7618618", "response": "The purpose of the patent is to provide a method for stabilizing a product against color degradation.
