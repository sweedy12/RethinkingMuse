The system may then convert to a third mode of operation as a four-stroke cycle engine during normal engine operation. Different operating modes are available during this normal engine operation. Under high demand conditions, the engine may be run as a conventional inefficient but effective throttled engine or converted to operate in a fourth mode as a two-stroke cycle engine. The system responds to second engine conditions to modify the parameters in a memory table and controls the vehicle in accordance with the parameters stored in the table.
