The sharp edge grips the pin and holds it against removal. In an alternative construction, only one end of the housing is provided with the pin entry, and only one end of the spring is turned inwardly to grip the pin. In both cases, the pressure of the inturned sharp edge is enhanced by the action of the spring coils. The second part of the clutch is thus a pin having a diameter slightly less than the internal diameter of the spring. The pin may be attached to a piece of jewelry such as an earring, etc. The pin can also be provided with one or more transverse grooves adapted to receive the sharp inturned end of the spring for a more positive grip and lock. The tube and spring can be made extremely small and can be sunk into a part of various jewelry items. With the tube in one part and a pin in the other, two jewelry portions can be joined by a frictional gripping action."}, {"id": "4292718", "response": "The purpose of the patent is to produce metal bearings.
