The rig as a whole can assume any angular position about a vertical axis. Under pressure of the wind, the foot of the sail can swing outward. The sail is mechanically linked to the seat boom so that its outward motion lifts the seat boom's outer end. The linkage is such that over a wide range of wind forces and regardless of the sailor's position along the boom, the rig as a whole exerts substantially no net moment on the hull. Foot operable rails are used to adjust the angle of the rig about the vertical axis, hence the angle of the sail to the wind.
