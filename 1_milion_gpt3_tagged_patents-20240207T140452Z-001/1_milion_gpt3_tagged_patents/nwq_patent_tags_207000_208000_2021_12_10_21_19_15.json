The flywheel is mostly composed of circumferentially wound fiber reinforced composite material. Induction loops are embedded in the skin of the flywheel, and a thin magnetic ring is positioned along the inside of the flywheel. This minimum excess mass is attached to the high strength flywheel in order to reduce the total parasitic momentum which will have to be controlled by the magnetic levitation system due to outside forces. A solid, hermetically sealed, physical enclosure surrounds the flywheel. A sealed vacuum chamber is located between the bulkhead and the flywheel. This bulkhead, in turn, is surrounded by another vacuum chamber formed between the bulkhead and an outer thermal insulation container, made of several thick layers of light weight crushable material.
