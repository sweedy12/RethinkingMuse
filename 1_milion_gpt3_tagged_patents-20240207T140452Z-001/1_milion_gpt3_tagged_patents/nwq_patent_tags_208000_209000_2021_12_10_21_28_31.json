Motion control is effected by an electro-hydraulic follow-up control valve with a pre-setting device controlled by a stepping motor and a mechanical actual-value feed-back device. During rapid feed motion, the relatively small working surface A.sub.1 is subjected to the output pressure of the follow-up control valve only, while during the working stroke the pressure acts additionally on the working surface A.sub.3. The rapid-return movements of the piston of the cylinder are controlled by applying pressure to the working surface A.sub.2, or by relieving pressure from the two other working surfaces A.sub.1 and A.sub.3. A pressure-controlled reversing valve is moved by the output pressure of a pilot valve control arrangement into its operating position corresponding to the working stroke when the output pressure P.sub.A of the follow-up control valve exceeds a pre-determined threshold value P.sub.sl, and returned to its operating position corresponding to the rapid motion conditions when the output pressure P.sub.A of the follow-up control valve has dropped to a value P.sub.s2 below or at least equal to the value P.sub.s1.A.sub.1 /A.sub.L, wherein in the particular case described L.sub.L =(A.sub.1 +A.sub.3)."}, {"id": "4873915", "response": "The purpose of the patent is to provide a machine for preparing a beverage.

The seating of the clamp is thereby wobble-free, and more particularly both when the clamp is inserted with only one end into a mounting as also when both bearing shell halves are assembled which then are held together without play. The secure seating of the clamps is attained by multiple linearly- and areally-like supports of the clamps and by springy abutment at the inwardly bent end areas of the legs of the clamp, whereby axially acting forces result. In addition to the assembly, also the disassembly is very simple because the clamps are constructed so as to be adapted to be overcome by pressure in two directions, and therefore the springy ends of the clamps need not be pressed down. The bearing shell halves merely have to be pulled apart which can take place with a commercially customary tool."}, {"id": "4875787", "response": "The purpose of the patent is to provide a bearing bushing for universal joint pins.
