The context of the patent is a meter, counter, printer or a like device wherein a shaft carries one or more wheels whose angular position with respect to the shaft must be changed, either at regular or irregular intervals. The peripheral surface of the shaft has an elongated recess which is parallel to the axis of the shaft. The inner portion of the recess receives an elongated elastic cushion, and the outer portion of the recess confines the major portion of a helical spring with spaced-apart convolutions. The smaller portion of the spring extends into a selected socket in the internal surface of a wheel or into selected sockets in the internal surface of two or more wheels which surround the shaft. The angular positions of the wheels can be changed by rotating the shaft relative to a selected wheel or vice versa with a predetermined torque which suffices to expel the smaller portion of the spring from the socket of the selected wheel by simultaneous deformation of the elastic cushion whereupon the cushion expands and propels the smaller portion of the spring into another internal socket of the selected wheel when the other socket moves into register with the recess.
