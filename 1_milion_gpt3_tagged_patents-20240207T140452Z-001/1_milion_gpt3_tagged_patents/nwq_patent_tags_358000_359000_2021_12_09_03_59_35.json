A discharge valve is employed for discharging fluid from one of the tanks under the equalized pressure. Prior to discharging any water, water and/or air is added to one of the tanks. The increase in pressure inside the tank is transferred to the other tank. The second tank is now capable of discharging the fluid contained therein under the increased pressure.
