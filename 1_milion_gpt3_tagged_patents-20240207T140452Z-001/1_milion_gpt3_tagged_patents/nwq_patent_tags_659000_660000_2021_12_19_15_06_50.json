The brine is pumped from an underground source, sprayed in ambient air over a solid surface and, if water is not completely evaporated, allowed to seep through the surface to saturate the capillary zone. Water is evaporated while the sprayed brine is in the air or on the surface where capillary action brings it up to the surface for the water component to be evaporated by net heat gained from the environment resulting in salt crystallization. The evaporation of sprayed brine is enhanced by smaller droplet size, residence time due the spray height and wind machines to reduce humidity and increase natural thermal input. The salt layer thus formed further grows by capillary action of the soil and the crystalline salt to a depth suitable for conventional mechanical harvesting. Instrumentation is included to optimize the method through the measurement of evaporation and moisture content of the lower boundary of the capillary zone of the soil and or crystalline salt."}]
